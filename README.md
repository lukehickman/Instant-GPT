InstantGPT is a chrome extension that utilizes the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT to provide quick and helpful information on demand. The extension can be easily accessed by using the keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl Shift S', which brings up the assistant for users to ask questions and receive responses. Additionally, the extension allows users to control the API parameters in the settings, providing a personalized experience. 

A key feature of this extension is the ability to summarize any text on a web page by highlighting the text, right-clicking, and selecting 'Summarize'. A pop-up window will then appear with a summary of the selected text. 

To use the extension, users must provide their own API key, which can be obtained for free from the OpenAI website.
